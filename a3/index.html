						<p>A household head's preference for lighting and cooking fuel can speak to their receptiveness to renewables, and lived experience vis-Ã -vis gender. </p>
						<br>
						<p>This series investigates gendered head of household fuel decisions through a handful of lenses.  The main factors considered are education, use case, and accessability of infrastructure.  World Bank household data offers a variety of interesting stories from these perspectives.  A few of the largest disparities are highlighted here. </p>
						<br>
						<p>Why these disparities exist will be explored via data from the Institute for Health Metrics. </p>
						<br>
						<p>Lastly, female representation in salient renewable infrastructure decision making bodies will be contrasted against the impact such decisions have on female health. </p>

						<p>Solid fuel and kerosene use for lighting and cooking is common across Nigeria.  As a result the nation's poor and underserved communities have an increased likelihood of a variety of respiratory diseases.  As women are still responsible for the majority of cooking across the country, they and their children are subjected to a greater burden of such diseases.</p>
						<br>
						<p>From the last section it is clear that this inequity is, in some capacity, understood and reflected in women's choice for cleaner, and safer options for lighting and cooking.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The UNDP has a unique opprotunity among these affected individuals to grow a community that will support renewable energy goals and, once and for all, address the gender delineated inequities that are the hallmark of solid fuel and kerosene use. </p>
